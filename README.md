This repository contains the final deployment setup for a Kubernetes-based application. It is designed to demonstrate a complete, production-ready environment with scalable microservices, efficient resource management, and secure configurations.

## **Project Overview**
This deployment leverages Kubernetes to manage containerized applications efficiently. Key components include:

- **Microservices Architecture**: Independent services running in isolated containers.
- **Load Balancing**: Seamless traffic distribution across pods.
- **Auto-scaling**: On-demand resource allocation to handle varying loads.
- **Service Discovery**: Smooth communication between services using Kubernetes services.
- **Persistent Storage**: Data persistence across pod restarts.
